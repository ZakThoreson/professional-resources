# Notes for completeing the Cloud Resume Challenge  
From scratch, I am planning to build a website for the Cloud Resume Challenge, with a full backend and CI/CD pipeline. 

# Notes
* Plan to run the website via Netlify?
* Generate basic website code via Hugo
* Integrate CI/CD capabilities with Git
  * Add security scans (Chekov / Prowler?)
  * The IaC component will be hosted internally (Gitea?) https://about.gitea.com/
* Add counter / form submission
  * https://termly.io/resources/articles/website-tracking/ 
  * Ideas: Vistors by country, page popularity, re-directs? 
* Links / Blog Posts -> Medium + Thoreson Consulting old content
